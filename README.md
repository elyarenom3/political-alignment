# political-alignment

Our aim is to educate canadian people on politics, provide a data-based (using scraping), as unbiased as possible, tool to promote informed voting and political engagement by providing users with information on how much their MP's legislation corresponds to their personal interests and political views. 

These are the resources we are data scraping from:
-https://www.ourcommons.ca/en/open-data
-https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bills

In the future, we plan to make this more comprehensive by adding more diverse resources but since this is for the mcwics hackathon and we are under time constraint, we are only using the resources above. 

For each of the 338 MP's in the house of commons, our program uses data scraping and natural language processing to identify which bills are pro and against certain issues, which are then matched against the information given by the participant in the survey and fed into our algorithm to make percentage matches.

We thought that the most accessible way to make this available would be to make it a website, so we designed a user-friendly interface and hosted it on github pages:
